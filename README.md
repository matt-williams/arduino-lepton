# Lepton library for Arduino

This is a library for accessing [Lepton](http://lepton.flir.com/) thermal imaging cameras from the Arduino environment.

To use it,

1.  download the [ZIP file](https://github.com/matt-williams/arduino-lepton/archive/master.zip)
2.  start the Arduino IDE
3.  choose "Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library..."
4.  select the ZIP file you downloaded.

It can then be added to existing projects using "Sketch -> Include Library -> Lepton", or you can find examples under "File -> Examples -> Lepton".
